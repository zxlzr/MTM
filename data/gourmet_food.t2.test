i using chemex 10-cup coffee maker almost year never such good coffee before my life . i am constantly looking forward my next pot coffee ! there downside this coffee maker : it more manual procedure than what you used , it also takes couple pots learn how use this most efficiently . first time i tried use mine , i ground my coffee way too finely it just took forever ! big time consumers : you boil your water separately ( you water kettle right ? ) then you gradually pour boiled water through chemex . this means while coffee brewing , you pouring , or watching , or giving filter area bit stir . now up side : you never ever ever drink better cup coffee . i use filtered water , freshly ground home roasted beans , this chemex produce finest coffee i ever pleasure drinking . this coffee pleasure ! fact , i've totally given up using cream sugar because my coffee no longer anything hide . up side : clean up means swishing chemex warm water tossing water down drain . you also wash bottle brush but this rarely necessary . brief swish really all it takes get your chemex looking factory new . try your electric drip machine ! ha ! thing never look brand new ! oh , here final upside : this chemex brews best coffee you'll ever drink , it costs less than just anything . you probably already spending more money than this every month starbucks ! go ahead buy yourself one these . if necessary , wake up 10 minutes earlier make your coffee . better yet , wake up 20 minutes earlier . when your coffee ready , instead dumping it into travel cup bolting out door , sit down enjoy your first cup next 10 minutes . you deserve it	1

if you only starting your trek into world serious coffee appreciation , then i highly suggest you , without haste , purchase one pound least whole bean jbm . also good grinder , temperature controlled machine decent water filtration system . pre-ground takes much flavor away , compaired properly fresh home ground coffee , coffee lessened without prepaired correct temperature filtered water . but why something so expensive ? why jump deep end pool before even getting your feet wet ? some may scoff , saying only true coffee fanatic would understand or able appreciate this blend . entirely true . but how anyone really understand without first tasted standard which all others must judged ? thus why this review only four out five stars . you see , jbm so subtle , so complex , new tounge not notice what makes jbm quite so wonderful . it " perfectly " blended coffee . flavor , bitterness , acidity aftertaste . scale one ten , they all rank dead even five . every other coffee like exaggeration this hard get bean . this should first coffee ever cross lips anyone who wants learn these things . how else you truely understand other blends	1

tazo teas relative newcomer tea market , founded 1994 steve smith . but , what tazo lacks history it makes up pure inventiveness ! among tazo many blends passion , bold flavorful mixture hibiscus flowers , other tropical flavors , citric acid , orange peel , licorice root , cinnamon bark , rose hips , lemongrass , red poppy . brew it up , you rewarded bright red infusion , tart exciting taste . now , this tea definitely not everyone . you tell ingredients , this tea strong decidedly tart side . when drunk hot , you probably want sweeten it honey or moderate it milk , or possibly both . but , when made into iced tea , passion really comes into its own - decidedly refreshing thirst-quenching . just what you need hot summer day ! so , overall i would say this pretty darn good hot tea , great iced tea . buy some today	1

when i first tasted this herbal infusion it seemed i tasted this flavor before when i lived africa . it much more delicate than rooibos tea golden rose color . when blended clover honey , it almost hint lemon . honeybush plant only grows high mountains western eastern cape regions south africa . i might first tasted this tea when we visited cape town went table mountain . plant harvested during flowering season . honeybush naturally sweet , caffeine free very little tannin . i still enjoy adding honey this tea enhance natural honey flavor . this mineral rich infusion rather soothing help calm nervous system . this technically wild mountain tea hint aromatic flowers . i only wish i drinking this tea while visiting table mountain . it gets rather chilly up there when you overlooking atlantic ocean . ~ rebecca revie	1
i originally bought this small container fleur de sel fish recipe i found said it " de rigeur " , however i thought it like any other salt simply grainier . course , i only added little bit salt after i grilled my fish not think it would add much dish . you imagine my surprise when i tasted fish , only veritable bouquet flavour explode my mouth . i must say i'm never going use commercial salt my food anymore . now i understand why great chefs past present consider this queen all salts ..	1

this good matcha price . best matcha much more expensive but well worth it , espcially if you happen study japanese tea ceremony or you tea connoseur . if you get this type tea , it wise buy proper bamboo wisk sift it first , otherwise it get lumpy . making matcha traditional way well worth effort there lot learn it . some say master tea ceremony take years . far health benefits go , there lot talk green tea good you i must say , i feel really good now i am drinking it 1-3 days per week i even lost few pounds . matcha caffine if i more than two or three bowls i definately feel it . it probably wise idea not drink too much matcha before bed ! green black tea both caffine most part . different teas different amounts caffine . it good idea read labels carefully your research if you sensitive caffine or must avoid it . type caffine beverage also lot how people respond it . caffine also different effect everyone depending your body . some people get jittery , others don't more caffine you consume less you tend feel effects it . i tend feel jittery coffee or soda but not tea . matcha also great smoothies , baking , ice cream much , much more . note ; fresh matcha very bright green color , old matcha gets darker pine-gray color it taste bitter or ashy clumpy consistancy . always note date . avoid stale green tea , i reccommend storing it airtight bag keeping it fridge . stale tea isn't noticable when you put it smoothie or cake but if you make hot beverage you notice big difference quality . matcha generally served sweets good paired fruity or vanilla desserts but it tends clash chocolate . course mochi ( sweet rice cakes ) go very well matcha traditional choice but unless you live near asian market , or you're good cook , they hard come short shelf life . frozen mochi ice cream nuggets good option too sold lot grocery stores . i reccommend this tea if you new drinking matcha . if you love it , it tastiest matcha it price range if you hate it , least you didn't waste too much cash . if you taking tea lessons it good ' practice ' tea won't break your pocketbook , especially when you find out price tea bowls , fukusa , natsume , furo other utensils used tea ceremony ! regardless if you study chado or if you casual tea drinker , i encourage all tea lovers try matcha . methods making preparing matcha over 800 years old when you taste it , you certainly understand why it never gone out style !	1

it really shame tastykake brand only established itself northeastern portion u.s.a. , rest world missing out finest pre-packaged snack pastry face this earth . those who unfortunate enough not know what tastykake , it like little debbie or hostess , which centered out philadelphia area . should you happen run into anybody philadelphia area ask them this line products , they inevitably tell you once you've experienced snack god tastykake butterscotch krimpet , those drake coffee cakes hostess twinkies no longer any appeal . it hard put into words just how fantastic these spongey , moist , vanilla butterscotch frosted guys . seriously , butterscotch krimpet even beat out many fresh baked bakery products , despite mass manufactured factory sealed boxes . i seriously suggest grabbing big jug chocolate milk ordering box these amazon right now , especially if you're not mid-atlantic region under false assumption hostess quality product . if so , you blown away krimpet culinary goodness . tastykake seemingly pompous slogan goes , " nobody bakes cake tasty tastykake . " once you experience butterscotch krimpet , you'll realize they more than substantial reason gloat .	1
